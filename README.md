<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I wanted to have a go at recreating my old website with tailwindcss before diving in and building out a new design.

Here's why:

- I have loved the idea of tailwind and what I might bring to a modern workflow
- The old site had many flaws such as its responsiveness that I need to fix

Of course, rebuilding the website is but a stepping stone learning how to use tailwindcss effectively enough to build a future portfolio that will best serve me is the end goal of this site

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

- [ViteJS](https://Vitejs.dev)
